Please view file above for details on the project. We refactored a lot of code in this project and made use of some design patterns. These patterns included the adapter, fascade, interceptor, builder, factory and momento pattern. I also implemented an One Time Password(OTP) security feature along with updating of the GUI and adding some unit tests using JUnit

The IDE used was IntelliJ
